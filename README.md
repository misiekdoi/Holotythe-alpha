Holotythe
=================

## Important ##

This is a test upload of Holotythe game rules, as the BattleScribe lacks proper documentation, I could've messed up big time and there's going to be a lot of bug fixes :)

## I found a bug / I'd do something differently ##

* Drop me an email - you can find the address in the ReadMe file when you create a new army
* [Open Issue directly][] (```New Issue```) - you need a GitHub account and then can track progress (get notifications on it!), comment (i.e. answer our questions) and help us better!

## I'd just like to contact you ##
